# TalentFlow â€“ A Mini Hiring Platform (Front-End Only)
# ALSALA AHMED-CE22B038
# Deployed on AWS EC2 - https://3.129.151.141/
## Overview
TalentFlow is a front-end React application that simulates a hiring management platform for HR teams. It enables managing **Jobs**, **Candidates**, and **Assessments** without a backend. All data is stored locally using **IndexedDB** via **Dexie** or **localForage**, and API calls are simulated using **MirageJS** or **MSW**.

## Features

### Jobs Management
- Create, edit, archive, and reorder jobs  
- Pagination and filtering by title, status, and tags  
- Validation for required title and unique slug  
- Drag-and-drop reordering with optimistic updates and rollback  
- Deep linking to job details `/jobs/:jobId`

### Candidates Management
- Virtualized list for 1000+ candidates  
- Client-side search (name, email) and server-like filtering (stage)  
- Candidate profile `/candidates/:id` with timeline of status changes  
- Move candidates between stages via Kanban board  
- Notes with `@mentions` (render-only, suggestions from local list)

### Assessments
- Job-specific assessment builder  
- Add sections and questions (single-choice, multi-choice, text, numeric, file upload)  
- Live preview pane for fillable forms  
- Validation rules (required, numeric range, max length)  
- Conditional questions (e.g., show Q3 only if Q1 === "Yes")  
- Responses stored locally
